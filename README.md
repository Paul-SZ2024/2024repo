[xx]"exam_GD" is an example of gradient descent optimization, with the matlab implementation.
It finds the minimum of a given function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[xx] "exam_Newton" is an example of Newton method, with the matlab implementation.
It finds the minimum of a given function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[xx]"exam_LM" is an example of Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm, with the matlab implementation.
It approximates a given function with noisy data. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[xx]"exam_bayesopt" is an example of bayesian optimization, with the matlab builtin function. 
It finds the minimum of a fiven function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and it 
should work well in its present form. 

[xx]"exam_gpr" is an example of Gaussian process regression, with the matlab implementatin. 
It predicts the mean and 95% trust region (2sigma) of a noisy sin(x) with the GPR algorithm.
